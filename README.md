Easily access the old Dell iDrac virtual console using non-installed portable versions of Firefox v.25 and Java 6.

The zip is packed using absolute pathnames. So it will create the "C:\temp\AccessIdracPortable\" folder structure.
1. Using 7-zip
2. Use "Extract Files ..."
3. Change "Path mode:" to "Absolute pathnames"
4. Will create the "C:\temp\AccessIdracPortable\" folder structure.
