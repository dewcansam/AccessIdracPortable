# How2_setup_AIP #

This how2 is the easiest way I found to run the
Java Web App that the Dell iDrac uses.

I have included the portable versions of:
Firefox v.25
Java 6

If you extract the zip, it will create the folders under "C:/temp/AccessIdracPortable/*"
if you want to change that and / or move them, then just make note of where you store them. The 2 exe's that we need are:
"C:\temp\AccessIdracPortable\FirefoxPortable_v-25_classic\FirefoxPortable.exe"
"C:\temp\AccessIdracPortable\Java\bin\javaws.exe"

1. Open Firefox v.25 portable
2. Navigate to the IP of the Dell iDrac
3. Under the Virtual Console Preview click "Launch"
4. You will get the "Open with" diagalog box
5. Click the drop down 
6. Click "other ..."
7. Click "Browse ..."
8. Paste "C:\temp\AccessIdracPortable\Java\bin\javaws.exe" into the File name box.
9. Click "Open"
10. Click "OK"
11. Make sure you see the "Java 6 ..." opening animation.
12. If you get any other Java or site warning box, make sure you are using the correct path to the Java 6 Portable Web Start Launcher.

On the first run you may have to check the Firefox Downloads or download settings. As without the initial profile it would try to dl it again.
